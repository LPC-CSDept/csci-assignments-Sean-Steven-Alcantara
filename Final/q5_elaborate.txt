Code Algorithm:

$t0 = base address of MMIO

rd_wait
get 32 bits from receiver control(0xffff0000) then check if LSB is 1 or 0 using and
If 0, then input is not ready yet.

else it is 1, so go to receiver data (0xffff0004) to get the value stored in there. Place it in $t4
subtract 48 from the input in $t4 to get the actual decimal

subtract 1 to digit count to know how many more digits will be taken by input
then multiply the number depending on what input number it is
if its the 1st digit, multiply it by 100 then store in $t4
if its 2nd digit, multiply by 10 then store in $t5
if its the 3rd digit, leave it in $t4

after getting all 3 digits add up $t4, $t5, $t6 then put it in $a0
print out the int value of $a0
end program


Only general registers are used in this program. The temp registers ($t).
$t0 holds base address of MMIO
$t1 is used for getting the value of receiver control to check if its ready or not
$t2 to $t4 holds the decimal values of the user input. $t2 is the 1st, and $t4 is 3rd digit
$t5 and $t7 is used for comparison in if-else statements
